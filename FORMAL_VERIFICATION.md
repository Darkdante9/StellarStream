# Formal Verification — StellarStream Contracts

**Issue #1387** · Type: Quality, Security · Priority: High

This document describes the formal verification framework for StellarStream's
critical smart contracts. Formal specs are expressed as pure Rust predicates,
exercised by property-based (fuzzing) and unit test runners built directly into
each contract crate — no external solver required.

## Overview

Formal verification in this project takes the form of **property-based testing
backed by mathematical invariants**. Each spec is a predicate function that
must return `true` for all valid inputs. The verifier runs tens of thousands
of deterministically generated random cases to find violations.

The approach is intentionally lightweight:

- **No external SMT solvers, no build-time toolchains beyond stable Rust.**
- Specs live next to the contract code they describe (`formal_spec.rs`).
- The runner (`verify.rs`) is a standard `#[cfg(test)]` module — CI runs it
  with `cargo test`.
- The `formal-verification` feature flag exposes spec modules for external
  tooling or future integration with model checkers such as Kani or MIRAI.

## Architecture

```
contracts/
├── Contract-V2/
│   └── src/
│       ├── formal_spec.rs   ← Spec predicates (SPY-*, SBC-*, SST-*, SAC-*, SEM-*)
│       └── verify.rs        ← Property-based runner (fuzz + unit tests)
├── splitter-v3/
│   └── src/
│       ├── formal_spec.rs   ← Spec predicates (PAY-*, BAL-*, STA-*, ACC-*, EMG-*)
│       └── verify.rs        ← Property-based runner
└── escrow/
    └── src/
        ├── formal_spec.rs   ← Spec predicates (EPY-*, EBL-*, EST-*, EAC-*, EEM-*)
        └── verify.rs        ← Property-based runner
```

Each `formal_spec.rs` module contains:

1. **Domain types** — pure Rust mirrors of the on-chain types (no `soroban_sdk`
   dependency, so they run in any test environment).
2. **Spec functions** — one function per spec ID, returning `bool`. Each
   function has a formal statement in its doc comment.
3. **Composite checker** — `check_all_*_specs()` calls every applicable spec
   for a given snapshot and returns a list of violated spec names.

Each `verify.rs` module contains:

1. **Fuzz tests** — `#[test]` functions that simulate 10,000–20,000 random
   inputs and assert all relevant specs pass on every iteration.
2. **Unit tests** — targeted tests for boundary conditions, edge cases, and
   boolean control-flow specs that are not naturally exercised by fuzz alone.
3. **Coverage report** — a `print_spec_coverage_report` test that prints a
   table of every spec and its verification method to the CI log.

## Running Verification Locally

### All contracts (recommended)

```bash
# From the repo root
for contract in Contract-V2 splitter-v3 escrow; do
  echo "=== Verifying $contract ==="
  cd contracts/$contract
  cargo test formal_verification -- --nocapture
  cd ../..
done
```

### Single contract

```bash
cd contracts/Contract-V2
cargo test formal_verification -- --nocapture
```

### With the formal-verification feature (exposes spec modules externally)

```bash
cd contracts/splitter-v3
cargo build --features formal-verification
```

### Expected output (passing)

```

## CI / CD Integration

The formal verification step is defined in
`.github/workflows/contracts-ci.yml` as the `formal-verification` job.

```
contracts-check (matrix: all 4 contracts)
       ↓  needs: contracts-check
formal-verification (matrix: Contract-V2, splitter-v3, escrow)
```

**Job behaviour:**

| Condition | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| All specs pass | ✅ Job green, coverage report written to step summary |
| Any spec violated | ❌ Job red, `VIOLATION` line printed with iteration details |
| Test binary crashes | ❌ Job red, exit code propagated |

**Artifacts:** Each run uploads a `formal-verification-report-<contract>` artifact
(retained 30 days) containing the full test output including coverage table and
any violation details.

**Step summary:** A Markdown table and collapsible coverage report is written to
the GitHub Actions step summary for each contract.

## Extending the Framework

### Adding a new spec

1. Open `contracts/<contract>/src/formal_spec.rs`.
2. Add a new predicate function with the next available ID in the group:

   ```rust
   /// PAY-6: Description of the new property.
   ///
   /// Formal statement:
   ///   <mathematical expression>
   pub fn spec_pay_6_my_new_property(/* args */) -> bool {
       // pure predicate, no side effects
   }
   ```

3. Add the spec to `check_all_payment_specs()` (or the appropriate composite).
4. Add a test (fuzz or unit) in `verify.rs`.
5. Update the coverage table in `print_spec_coverage_report`.

### Integrating a model checker (future)

The `formal-verification` feature flag exposes `pub mod formal_spec` without
needing the `soroban_sdk` testutils. This makes the spec modules usable with:

- **Kani** (`cargo kani`) — bounds checking and proof harnesses
- **MIRAI** — abstract interpretation over MIR
- **Prusti** — Rust spec annotations with Z3 backend

To integrate, add the model checker as a dev-dependency gated on the feature
and write proof harnesses in a separate file (e.g., `kani_harness.rs`).
